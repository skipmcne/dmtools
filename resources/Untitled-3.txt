Looking for some engaging quests and direction for a party intent on subverting the evil and corruption in a young D&D democracy. 

The town has gone from a theocratic oligarchy of good-ish alignment to a pan-religious democracy that is fair to its citizens, but consistently violates the rights of its thousands of incarcerated prisoners. Its policy of religious tolerance has allowed worship of Asmodeus and Vecna to operate openly in public and government. The agrarian society has transformed into an industrialized factory system that uses slave labour from the prisons. And the public is unable to distinguish legitimate criticism of the system with violent terrorism (of which the city has many of both). 

The party has been operating in the city for a while, accepting the good with the bad, but one of the exiled town founders has reached out to them, offering them a chance to reform the system. Their reputation is sterling, so no-one would suspect them of being double-agents with the good rebels, but fraternizing with the exiles would result in imprisonment. 

For their cover, they need to continue performing their regular duties as adventurers, but they'll also get some missions involved in destabilizing the city-state's government in order to return the town founders to power and eliminate the bad influences. I need some ideas for quests to enable that: some on foreign soil, some undercover in town, with a variety of goals. They'll have some assistance outside of town, but in town, there are a variety of high-level threats that could uncover what they're up to. 

(Also, their end goal is to remove the evil democracy with a good oligarchy of adventurers, and from my initial probing, the party seems totally okay with that. If they succeed, I'll present them with the problems inherent in doing that, but I hope they'll address that before the coup.)
