Misshapen Giants Emerge From Mournland, Attack Keep

ARULDUSK—Horribly twisted creatures more than twenty feet tall hurled boulders and wrecked under-construction fortifications at Angwar Keep on Zol, fleeing at dusk back into the Mournland.

More than a dozen creatures were involved in the attack, which left more than twenty Thrane soldiers dead. They appeared to be giants, yet their faces and limbs had what one survivor called a “melted” appearance.

Concerted efforts by the Thrane garrison and a group of warforged veterans known as the Redeemed repulsed the creatures after a pitched battle.

Angwar Keep commander said the garrison has been doubled to guard against further attacks. Patrols north to Olath and south to Aruldusk will be larger and more frequent, he said.

“If there’s one thing my boys have, it’s practice guarding this stretch of coast,” he said. “Whether it’s Cyrans, Karrnathis, or more horrors from the Mournland, we’ll stop it and push it back into the water,” he said.

After the battle, the surviving giants swam back across the northern edge of Lake Arul and were last seen heading toward the ruins of the Cyran city of Eston. The Eston ruins are rumored to hold great wealth from the settlement’s heyday as a mining community, but few who cross the river into the Mournland ever return.
