Banditry Delays Airship’s Maiden Voyage

DRAGONROOST—An attack by marauders from the Howling Peaks will result in a three-week delay for House Lyrandar’s newest high-speed airship, the Power of Purity announced on Zor.

A force of more than three dozen bandits, mostly humans and goblinoids, attacked the Power of Purity’s Swiftwind facility in northwest Zilargo. The bandits were eventually turned away by Purity’s wizards and the elemental creatures that roam the site of their own volition.

But before retreating into the mountains, the bandits were able to set fire to a hangar that contained a nearly complete airship. The as-yet-unnamed airship is the first of a new high-speed design and was destined to be christened by House Lyrandar next month.

Power of Purity founder Harkra Loivaerl Lonadar called on Zilargo to increase patrols in the foothills of the Howling Peaks to end the bandit menace.

“This sort of thing is bad for research, bad for business, and bad for Zilargo,” she said.

The Power of Purity, known for its esoteric approach to elemental binding techniques, is among the most sought-after construction yards for airships.

House Lyrandar has ongoing but sporadic talks with the Power of Purity to become an exclusive supplier to the House, but those talks haven’t come to fruition. It’s unknown what effect the most recent delay would have on those talks.
