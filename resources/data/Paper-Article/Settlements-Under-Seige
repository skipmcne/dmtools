Q’barran Settlements Under Siege from Lizardfolk

NEWTHRONE—The town of Whitecliff and surrounding villages are on the verge of being overrun by lizardfolk, said Whitecliff’s mayor in an urgent missive seeking aid from King Sebastes ir’Kesslan.

“We are a proud, hardy people, but make no mistake: We may not survive the month,” said a letter from Mayor Karala Thautram delivered by courier on Zol. “Hundreds, if not thousands, of lizardfolk are encamped among our communities, attacking on a nightly basis.”

Travel in the north has been rendered impossible, Thautram’s letter said. Outlying settlements have been destroyed or evacuated, with all able-bodied soldiers resisting the siege at Whitecliff or in a handful of villages that remain standing.

The lizardfolk belong to the Poison Dusk tribe, known for their diminutive stature and the potent toxins on their weapons, Thautram’s letter said. According to the letter, the tribe often clashes with settlers in the north, but large-scale raids are “unprecedented and puzzlingly uncharacteristic.”

Courtiers speaking on condition of anonymity said King Sebastes would issue a decree of support tomorrow morning and send a column of soldiers northward to break the siege of Whitecliff and force the lizardfolk back into the jungle.

Among the troops marching north will be a contingent of Riedran infantry, sent to Q’barra last year as a goodwill gesture from the Inspired leaders of that nation across the sea.
