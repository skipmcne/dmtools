Aundair Army Captures Rebel Leader

WYR—Aundair has captured the druid known as Amleerin the Fox, a proclamation from the army’s headquarters in Wyr announced on Zor.

Amleerin, a member of the mysterious Ashbound sect, has been wanted by Aundair’s border patrols for eight months following a series of raids across the Wynarn River northeast of Lake Galifar.

Throughout the spring and summer, villages have been reduced to smoldering ruins with a distinctive glowing sigil inscribed in the trunk of a nearby tree.

The attacks reached their apex in Nymm, when the village of Jarran in the hills south of Windshire was burned to the ground, killing more than 200 residents. Authorities were unable to determine why none of the residents fled from the flames. All were found in their residences, as if they succumbed in their sleep.

Amleerin was captured after a pitched battle on the banks of the Wynarn River. An Aundair border patrol unit cordoned off the area after independent scouts working for the Aundair military reported contact with Amleerin and a small band of marauders.

“These brave soldiers slowly drew the cordon closer, fighting back escape efforts from the arsonists and murderers,” an army staff proclamation read. “In the end, Amleerin had no choice but to stand on the banks of the River Wynarn and surrender to the justice of Aundair.”

Unconfirmed reports from the Eldeen Reaches suggest that the Wardens of the Wood were also hunting down Amleerin for attacks on hamlets on the western side of the Wynarn River.

Amleerin will transported under heavy guard to Fairhaven, where he’ll be tried for multiple counts of arson, murder, and related crimes.
