Breland Apologizes for Arrest of Orien Scion

VATHIROND, BRELAND—General Jorekk Blandra, commander of the King’s Own 4th Border Army, apologized on Sar for the day-long detention of a high-ranking member of House Orien traveling to Sharn on House business.

“In our zeal to protect the borders of this fair nation from interlopers and criminals, we misinterpreted some sensitive intelligence,” he said in a written statement issued from the army’s keep northwest of the city. “Our sincerest apologies go out to Jarla d’Orien and members of her entourage for the delay.”

Jarla d’Orien oversees the house’s caravan operations throughout western Khorvaire. Her detention in Vathirond last week brought a swift response from House Orien, which briefly suspended lightning rail service to Breland destinations in response to the arrest. She was freed last Zor.

General Blandra’s statement did not mention the specific charges that resulted in d’Orien’s arrest, nor the nature of the intelligence that his staff misinterpreted. Staff officers of the King’s Own 4th said the general was traveling back to Wroat and unavailable for further comment.
