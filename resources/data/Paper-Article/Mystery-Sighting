Ghost Ship Sighted South of Sharn

SHARN—A glowing ship moving “arrestingly fast” against the wind was sighted near dawn on Far, traveling without benefit of sail or oars, said reports from two nearby vessels.

The inbound cargo galley Sarah, Green With Envy and the Lhazaar fishing vessel Frostfeather both reported the ship to the Sharn harbormaster upon landing later that day.

No crew was visible aboard the ship, which passed within “a few hundred feet” of the Lhazaar ship, according to a copy of the ship’s log obtained by the Sharn Inquisitive. Present throughout the encounter was a “maddening gurgling and howling, as if the drowned were trying to escape their watery graves.” The glowing ship ran parallel to the Frostfeather for several minutes, then cut across her bow and made for the horizon. Wave action and light fog obscured it about ten minutes later.

The Sarah, Green With Envy galley saw the glowing ship at a greater distance, reporting it heading southwest at great speed.

Breland Navy Commandant Janoi ir’Nauphtula said that routine patrols saw no unusual activity yesterday nor so far today. If the ship was neither hostile nor in distress, then it’s likely any outbound vessel wouldn’t report seeing it until it reached its next port. Thus more information may become available in coming days or weeks, she said.

One possibility is that the glowing ship is another sighting of Lightning on Water, a House Lyrandar wind galleon reported missing in Rhaan and rumored to hold a great treasure. Reports from sailors last month indicated that the ship may be traveling along Khorvaire’s southern coast with only its bound elemental controlling it.

Untharr Queetan, captain of the Frostfeather, was unavailable for comment. Officials of House Lyrandar were unavailable at press time, but they have refused to discuss the Lightning on Water incident since the ship’s disappearance this fall.
