Brideveil Waterfall Reverses Course

MOONWATCH, BRELAND—The mysterious magical phenomena afflicting western Breland have reappeared in dramatic fashion, as the Brideveil Waterfall started flowing upward on Wir.

The rest of the Sorrihla river continues to flow in its usual direction, with only the water within a half-mile of the waterfall heading upstream. Local observers said the water itself appears normal, and some enterprising anglers have even caught some trout from the pools below the waterfall.

The scenic waterfall at the headwaters of the Sorrihla has religious significance for local druids, who have seasonal ceremonies there. But druid leader Skytalon said that she’s as baffled as anyone else by the reversed waterfall.

“I urge patience and calm,” she said. “Surely the meaning of the current strangeness will reveal itself in time. The natural world often reveals its secrets like a rose unfurling its petals.”

The waterfall’s reversal has no overt connection to other strange phenomena in western Breland this spring, including:

Clouds forming strange sigils in the sky over Ardev in Eyre.
Every apple grown within two days’ travel of Ringbriar tasting normal but developing bright blue skin.
Deer and elk dropping their antlers—normal in autumn but unheard of in spring.
The utter disappearance of the Chaarkia Woods south of Ardev.
Unusually high tides along Breland’s southwest coast.
