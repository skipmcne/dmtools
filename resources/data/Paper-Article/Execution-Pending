Last of ‘Exchequer Conspirators’ to be Hanged Tomorrow

SHARN—Disgraced scribe Anastro Lavatri, convicted last year of treason in the wake of the “Exchequer Scandal,” will be hanged tomorrow in front of Andith Tower in the Ambassador Towers district.

Lavatri’s barrister, Bandaran Urnash, said last week that he’d exhausted his legal appeals, and that the writ of commutation which would have spared his life has languished in the Breland Parliament.

Lavatri’s execution will bring to a close an embarrassing scandal at the vaunted King’s Citadel. Three staff officers and two scribes, including Lavatri, were convicted last Olarune of embezzling funds for the city’s defense, and building themselves opulent towers on the Upper Central plateau.

The conspiracy was uncovered only after a routine crown audit noticed some discrepancies in the Citadel’s books. At trial, some witnesses expressed doubt as to whether Lavatri realized the ledger entries he made were fraudulent.

Although she wasn’t implicated in wrongdoing, the scandal led Knight-Marshal Chanarri Yewn to resign her commission. Her crown-appointed replacement, Knight-Marshal Banarak Tithon, holds the post to this day. He is expected to oversee Lavatri’s execution.
