Land Grants Delayed for Warforged Veterans

WROAT—Warforged barrister and advocate Hectran petitioned the crown on Zor to begin an official inquiry into “shameful” delays in processing warforged applications for a variety of land-grant programs for military veterans.

“My people served with honor and distinction in some of Breland’s most trying times,” he said. “But the small-minded prejudice of petty bureaucrats is preventing them from serving the realm with distinction in peacetime as well.”

In the petition, Hectran listed more than four hundred warforged veterans whose applications for land grant programs, mostly the Heroes of Breland decree in 996 and the Farm Productivity Act of 997, have been in limbo. Few warforged can even obtain acknowledgement that their applications have been received, he said.

“The Treaty of Thronehold guaranteed full rights for our warforged citizens,” Hectran said. “The king should root out those in the government who don’t support the Treaty and the rights it promises all of us.”

Hectran’s petition next goes to the Parliament, where the Select Committee on Warforged Relations will consider it. After advisory votes from both the committee and the full Parliament, it then goes to the throne for action.

Retired General Avask Orakanoll, who advocated strongly for the Heroes of Breland land-grant decree, said that any inquiry into the administration of the land grants will turn up a “viper’s nest.”

“It’s not really an anti-warforged issue—at least not to the degree that Hectran says it is,” Orakanoll said. “The land grants aren’t happening for anyone—the whole system is corrupt. Local lords are doing everything they can to get their hands on fallow or vacant land themselves.”
