Mysterious ‘Red Box’ Packages Found Across Sharn

SHARN—At least a dozen small red crates have been delivered to residences and businesses across the city this week, but the boxes’ seemingly random contents have mystified their recipients.

Noted Redstone district seamstress Sheeran Veel reported the first red box last Zol—a box containing fourteen platinum coins and a broken compass. Since then, the boxes have shown up across the breadth and height of the city.

Children playing in a Tumbledown district alley found a red box with four broken-tipped daggers, a city watch sergeant said. The office of Councillor Caskar Halavik received a red box with a live black cat in it. And a Callestan district dream parlor known as Silvermist received a red box with a case of fine Aundairan wine.

Thus far, no one has seen how the boxes are delivered, and they bear no seal, insignia, or other markings. Most are discovered in the early morning—an average of one per day.

The offices of the Sharn Inquisitive received a red box last Zol, but it had only blank parchment in it.

A few of the boxes have had grisly contents. One found in Skysedge Park near the statue of General Beneretto contained a severed human hand, and a box received on Far by Morgrave University’s historian and musician-in-residence Allorius Derethe contained a black, foul-smelling substance.

Lt. Illara Drendo of the Sharn Watch’s Blackened Book branch, which investigates magical threats against the city, said anyone coming into contact with a red box should bring it to the Blackened Book headquarters in Warden Towers. Do not open the box, she said.
