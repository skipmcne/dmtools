Thrane Decorates ‘Bridge of Stars’ for Anniversary Festival

SIGILSTAR, THRANE—City officials said on Sar that preparations are nearly complete for a major festival to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Bridge of Stars.

Lord Mayor Lahira ir’Vanaisho stated that a Thrane Army parade would march across the bridge at noon, to be followed by religious services in the Temple of the Silver Flame and a circus on the hills southwest of the bridge. Dignitaries from nearby communities have been invited to attend, as have bishops and priests from Flamekeep.

The Bridge of Stars has long been a source of pride for Thranes for two reasons. First, it’s a replacement for an earlier bridge destroyed by Breland in the 940s. Second, Thranes take great pride in their ability to construct such an architectural wonder despite the rigors of war; the bridge took nearly 18 years to complete, with work halted several times during wartime.

The bridge is wide enough for eight wagons to travel abreast, and is more than 10 feet taller at midspan than the original bridge it replaced, enabling larger barges to reach towns upriver from Sigilstar.

But what draws attention is the surface of the bridge itself, rendered magically transparent so that travelers can gaze downward into the Thrane River. Also noteworthy are clusters of magical flames on the superstructure, arranged into familiar constellations, which give the bridge its name.

The transparency of the bridge can be somewhat frightening to newcomers.

“At first, you don’t think there’s anything there,” said Harlech Brandaol, a visitor from the Mror Holds. “When you take that first step, you think you’ll plummet right into the river for a swim. But it feels sturdy under your feet, and that’s what you really want in a bridge.”
