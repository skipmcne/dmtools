Invitations Sent for Conqueror Tourney

KORTH—Noted conqueror aficionado Baron ir’Kantarros has sent out nearly a hundred invitations to players of the board game, inviting them to a first-ever continent-wide tournament.

The tournament, called Challenge for New Khorvaire, offers the ultimate victor a land grant in southwest Karrnath. Other top players will earn gold coins, jewelry, and other prizes, ir’Kantarros said.

“After a century of war, there’s no better way to usher in a new era than to have the world’s finest strategic minds moving pieces on a conqueror board, not armies on a battlefield,” he said.

Famous conqueror players like Jurra Nellan, Col. Taruth of Cyre, and “Immense” Herrat Mensetain have already indicated their intention to compete, ir’Kantarros said.

“We’ll also be inviting some of Khorvaire’s acclaimed military leaders,” ir’Kantarros said. “And noted minds from other fields as well—the invitation list is as inclusive as possible.”

Those invited should receive their invitations within the next two weeks. Included with the invitation is round-trip lightning rail passage to Korth, ir’Kantarros said.

Also competing in the challenge will be ir’Kantarros’ nephew, Varro ir’Hatarr. Varro won last year’s Karrnath conqueror competition, although the final rounds were marred by the unauthorized use of divination magic by some contestants. Tourney rules strictly forbid such assistance, ir’Kantarros said.
