Smoke from Wildfires Darkens Skies Over Vedykar

VEDYKAR, KARRNATH—Wildfires across southeast Karrnath and the Talenta Plains has laid a thick pall of smoke across Vedykar.

The smoke has limited visibility to less than 50 feet, even at noon. The smoke appeared on the southern horizon on Zol and descended over the city the next day.

The Karrnathi Army units at Hundrach Barracks have been deployed to the city streets as a precautionary measure. The elderly and the young are advised to remain indoors, said town criers from the lord mayor’s office yesterday.

Wildfires on the grassy plains are common in the height of summer, but the first seem to be more frequent and spreading further north this year.

Druids affiliated with the halfling clans of the Talenta Plains are said to be using weather magic to battle the blazes. But some Karrnathis wonder whether the druids are entirely altruistic.

“Every year we hear about how the druids are going to conjure up rainstorms to stop the fires,” said Ulvey ir’Prachtaal, a count with extensive holdings east of Vedykar. “Yet I notice that it’s strong winds from the southeast that are pushing the smoke—and eventually the fires—our way. If you can conjure up rainstorms, I’ll bet you can conjure up a southeast wind, too.”
