Valenar Ambassador Protests Warhorse Sales

SHARN -- A recent auction of Valenar warsteeds amounts to "wholesale theft of our heritage as a warrior people," Valenar ambassador Daera Sorandal said on Mol. Speaking from the great hall of the Caerlyn's Blade stronghold in Middle Dura, Sorandal insisted that city leaders should enact laws to prevent future sales of the special warhorses that are held in high regard by the seminomadic elves of southeast Khorvaire.

"A nation that takes such pains to portray itself as a beacon of justice should know better," she said. "Allowing the sale of our warsteeds is tantamount to selling the very spirit of our people."

Sorandal went on to announce a price on the head of Syrrak Nayairt, the renegade Valenar elf who shipped the warhorses to Sharn by sea, then auctioned them off last month. She further stated that Valenar intended to reacquire the horses sold at auction as soon as the buyers could be tracked down. She said that financial reimbursements would be made where possible.

"We take great pride in our horses, and it's understandable that others would want them as breeding stock. But the ancient blood that flows through the veins of our warsteeds should not be lightly mingled with that of more mundane animals," Sorandal stated.

In answer to questions, Sorandal said that periodic auctions of Valenar riding horses were "distasteful," but represented an important source of income for some of the forty-five warclans that make up the Valaes Tairn. "The sale of warhorses, on the other hand, is anathema among all clans," she maintained.
