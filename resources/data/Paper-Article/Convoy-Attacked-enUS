Relief Convoy Attacked in Western Aundair

WYR, AUNDAIR—A convoy carrying food and healers to the village of Salanoux was destroyed less than a mile from its destination last week, caught in the crossfire of border clashes across Aundair’s northwest border.

Representatives of the Aundairian army and guerilla forces known as the Eldeen Wolves blamed each other for the attack on the twelve-wagon caravan. No survivors had been found as of last Wir, nor eyewitnesses to the attack.

The convoy, organized by Lord Egan ir’Ransaldrie in response to pleas for assistance, did have a contingent of guards but was flying a blue flag—often used in western Khorvaire to indicate noncombatant status.

Lord ir’Ransaldrie said he was heartbroken at the loss.

“My family has its roots in Salanoux, and when I heard that their granary had been looted a few weeks ago, I had to act,” he said. “Many good Ransaldries died on that road, and I want to know who’s responsible.”

Colonel Borchard of the nearby Otharaunt fortress said that the Aundairian army would be securing Salanoux and surrounding homesteads within the next two days, and would arrange a relief effort if starvation or illness was pervasive.

“I can assure the Lord that my troops would never attack a relief caravan, even if we weren’t informed about it ahead of time. That’s the sort of thing the Wolves do, not us.”

A missive from Rhunadask, leader of the Eldeen Wolves, posted throughout Wyr on Zol, also denied responsibility for the attack, calling it “further evidence that Aundair will stop at nothing to keep the Eastern Reaches under the heel of the jackboot. Only a tyrant would starve her own citizens, then blame others for her perfidy.”
