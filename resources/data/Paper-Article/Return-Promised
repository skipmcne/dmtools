Thrane Promises Return of Minnarek Friezes

SHARN—The Minnarek Friezes, taken by Thrane soldiers during the Last War, will be returned to Breland by year’s end, said Anador ir’Laisha, speaking on behalf of the Keeper of the Flame.

The twelve friezes, which depict in bas-relief torch-bearing men on horseback, are considered some of the best examples of pre-Galifaran sculpture. Nearly 2,000 years old, they were originally created by the blind sculptor Minnarek as a tribute to Karrn the Conquerer and decorated a shrine in Hatheril that commemorated Karrn’s victory in the Battle of Brey.

In 959, Thrane soldiers removed the friezes from the Hatheril shrine because their subject matter included torch flames. The friezes were taken to Flamekeep, where they remained on display until the signing of the Treaty of Thronehold two years ago.

“All of Thrane hopes that the restoration of these friezes can mark a new stage in our relations with Breland,” ir’Laisha said. “Now that the war is over, a lot of these artistic treasures, swept up in the winds of war, can be returned to their rightful owners.”

Thrane is eager to establish a commission with artists and historians from all of the Thronehold signatories to establish procedures for the return of national treasures, she said.

“We’ve made our views on artistic heritage well known, and now that Khorvaire is at peace, we’ll push more strongly for all nations to return objects of artistic and cultural relevance. Karrnath’s continued custody of the Gorith Handmaiden Tryptych, for example, continues to sadden the hearts of art lovers everywhere,” she said.
