Guards Thwart Wizardry Attack on City Hall

SHARN—An attack on Sun Tower on Sar halted debates on tower petitions all afternoon and disrupted city business until the demise of the lone assailant.

The wizard, a middle-aged female human, strode through the tower’s West Hall shortly after noon and began summoning various deadly creatures and creating other magic effects.

Nearby Council Guards evacuated City Hall visitors and cordoned off the West Hall.

“We called for assistance from reserves elsewhere in the council hall, and we approached with a fair amount of caution—you can’t be too careful with the council at stake,” said guard captain Lyshan Aurria. “But it turned out that a lot of the intruder’s magic was just cunning illusions.”

Aurria said the woman ignored all attempts at communication. When guards moved to arrest her, she attacked with potent fire magic.

The resultant battle left five council guards badly wounded. The assailant attempted to flee to the northwest, then leapt off Opellar’s Span, landing on Cursive Street several hundred feet below.

The assailant died on impact with the street. Authorities are attempting to establish her identity.

By sundown council guards had returned to their posts throughout Sun Tower, and normal business resumed.

Speaking on the main steps that evening, Lord Mayor Cathan ir’Demell praised the quick thinking of the council guards on duty in the West Hall.

“We may never know what motivated this crazed magician to attack the foundation of Sharn’s government,” ir’Demell said. “But we do know that the bravery and grace under pressure demonstrated by our guards today exemplifies what service to Sharn is all about.”
