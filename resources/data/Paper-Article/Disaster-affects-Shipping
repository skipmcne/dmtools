Freak (rand-nth disaster) Wreaks Havoc With Scions Sound Shipping

KORTH—A massive windstorm on Zor left eight ships aground on the Karrnathi coast and more than two dozen vessels severely damaged.

The storm, which began shortly after nightfall, also caused extensive damage to light structures in coastal communities on both sides of Scions Sound. Gale-force western winds and high seas pushed most shipping traffic dangerously near the cliffs of Karrnath, although a few vessels were able to find a measure of safety in natural harbors on the Aundairan side of the sound.

Two vessels, the Gleam in Her Eye and Saber’s Point, were abandoned by their crews and suffered heavy damage against the cliffs. More than forty sailors from the Saber’s Point are missing and believed drowned, and observers say it’s unlikely the ships will be salvageable.

A trio of Karrnathi war galleys—the Indefatigable, the Dauntless, and the Righteous Retribution—suffered extensive hull and rigging damage. They remain anchored just east of Rekkenmark, awaiting available docks for repair in Korth.

Karnnathi ambassador Randarr ir’Hothelech said the crown was summoning House Lyrandar leaders to the palace to “get some answers” about the house’s ongoing weather control efforts. Due to the presence of the House Lyrandar enclave of Stormhome at the mouth of the Scions Sound, storms of any kind are rare in the stretch of sound between the ocean and Thronehold.

No House Lyrandar vessels were damaged in the windstorm, but Lyrandar wind galleons were instrumental in rescue and recovery efforts in the storm’s aftermath.
