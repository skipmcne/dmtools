Dream Serpent Hides Become Fashion for Caravan Dancers

KORRANBERG—Aficionados of the dance known as the caravan have turned to Xen’drik for their newest fashion: capes fashioned from the hides of dream serpents.

The green and silver capes have swept across masquerade balls and formal dances across southern Khorvaire, with some exclusive events barring entry to dancers garbed in mere silk, satin or starweave.

“There’s just something about the way the silver flashes during a double-swirl—it makes the entire dance more elegant,” said Lahana ir’Yeshri, a noted caravan dancer. “And during the more vigorous parts of the dance, the green scales on the cape take on a luminous quality.”

The dream serpent capes first became popular when explorers returning from Xen’drik sold a large quantity of hides to Chandri Thomm, a Korranberg seamstress.

Acquiring more dream serpent hides has proven difficult, however, because the poisonous creatures are exceedingly dangerous and because the drow elves native to Xen’drik regard explorers from Khorvaire as poachers. Existing Thomm-labeled capes have fetched soaring prices as they’re passed from noble to noble.

Several Zilargan clothiers plan expeditions to Xen’drik in the coming weeks to capture enough dream serpents to bring back to Khorvaire for breeding.
