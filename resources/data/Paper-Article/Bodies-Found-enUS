Four Bodies Found in Burned Carriage

SHARN—City Watch are investigating as homicide the burned-out shell of a carriage found at dawn Zor on northern Razzell Street in the Granite Halls district.

Watch sergeant Garrick Draum said four bodies—three adult male humans and one female shifter—were seated in the carriage. Traces were attached to the carriage, but no horses were present, he said.

The carriage itself was badly charred but cool to the touch. The flames didn’t spread to any nearby buildings, Draum said.

“I find it a little hard to believe that, even in the wee hours of the morning, no one saw a carriage fire in the middle of the street,” Draum said. Shops along Razzell Street—mostly antiquities dealers—were shuttered, and the street gets little night traffic.

The Blackened Book branch of the Sharn Watch is trying to ascertain the identity of the passengers in the carriage, Draum said. And the City Watch is trying to find eyewitnesses who saw the carriage or the fire; those with information should speak to the City Watch on patrol in Granite Halls or speak to a sergeant on duty at the Watch’s Sword Point garrison.
