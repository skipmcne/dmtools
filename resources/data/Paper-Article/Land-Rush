Hundreds Head East in Karrnathi Land Rush

VULYAR, KARRNATH—Roads and inns throughout southeast Karrnath have been far busier than usual, bolstered by hundreds seeking the chance next week to gain free title to land southwest of Irontown and Fort Deepdark.

Hundreds are expected to claim parcels of the former estates of the ir’Hauptrach, ir’Jennrei, and southern ir’Orall families. Ownership of the estates reverted to the crown after the last heirs of those families perished during the Last War.

Because the land is only marginally arable and has no strategic significance, Karrnath is eager to return it to private ownership—and the tax rolls.

While such organized homesteading efforts are commonplace in Aundair and Breland, the division of these three estates marks the first time King Kaius III has consented to such a redistribution.

Would-be landed gentry have come from as far as southern Breland, the Shadow Marches, and the Lhazaar Principalities to have a chance at more than 100 parcels of land. Other than a good-faith deposit that depends on the size of the parcel, the land is free for the taking—with a proviso that the new owners till the land or build a defensible structure within two years of taking ownership.

In the likely event that there are more applicants than parcels of land, the crown has empowered Brandin ir’Dulinch, commander of Fort Deepdark, to assess the fitness of applicants to manage the land and to conduct a lottery for the parcels.

Former citizens of Cyre and elves with demonstrable connections to Valenar are ineligible to participate, according to the terms of the decree. Other foreigners are eligible so long as they renounce citizenship elsewhere and swear fealty to the Karrnathi crown.
