; Character files contain character descriptions, preferences, traits, habits, props unique to that 
; particular character (does this character have a quizzing glass through which he stares at people 
; he finds inferior? an umbrella she unfurls in the house?). Character-specific dialogue also goes 
; here: anything that character might have to say about his backstory, amusing incidents that 
; recently happened to him, etc. In the currently available content, for instance, the character of
;  Lucy has certain flirtation actions that are unique to her, but that create openings for 
; relationship change that use the standard underlying mechanisms for changing relationship state. 
; This means that other characters who have unique strategies for responding to flirtation can react 
; appropriately, even if the two characters have not explicitly been coded to interact with one 
; another.

;Character files contain information about what the character hopes to achieve and how he might respond to blockages or problems along the way.
 Some characters need to make money, or marry well.
  Some like to make friends, or have some long-standing self-image issue that is preventing their happiness.
   These arc elements can be satisfied in a variety of ways: for instance,
    a character who needs to increase her income might stumble across a chest of gold in an adventure plot, 
    or marry a rich man in a high-society plot.
