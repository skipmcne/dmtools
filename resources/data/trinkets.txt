The whispering continues to grow louder while the sensations escalate, until the whispers can almost be made out, at which point the holder falls unconscious for an hour.
A singular, tattered playing card with a very faded face side. When shuffled into a deck being used for a game, it is frequently drawn in the owner’s opening hand, with the face side of a valuable card for whichever game is being played.

When pulled from the deck, the card is in it’s normal, faded state.
