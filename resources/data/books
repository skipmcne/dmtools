0815: An Arm and a Leg: Sacrificial rituals and you by B. Regulus
0816: A treatise on the efficacy of somnulent mystical energies upon members of the genus Aves by R.S. Binns - A paper so tremendously boring that it is far more effective at putting people to sleep than the writer's spells ever were.
0817: A Spotter's Guide for Invisible Things by L. Lovegood - A book detailing the habits and habitats of the mystical equivalent of cryptids. However, at least a few of the entries have been proven to be real since the time it was written...
0818: The Color of Magic by T. Pratchett - As soon as anyone tries to pick up this book, the arm of an orangutan reaches out from between the shelves and snatches it from them. Examination shows that there is not, in fact, any place behind the shelves for it to have been taken to.
0819: Dousing the Stars by ???? - This book is written in an unknown language, and the author's name has been entirely scratched out. Should the text be translated, it will be shown to be a list of various spells that are nigh-impossible to cast and would have apocalyptic ramifications if they ever were to be cast. One of the pages is covered in scribbled hand-written notes. Several of these notes have checkmarks next to them, and one is triple-underlined and circled. The final note on the page says "Well... now I just have to see if it will work."
0820: The Iron Tome - This book isn't actually titled, but is instead made entirely from iron. It contains several ancient spells made during a war against the fae (although since then more effective spells have been created, and thus the text is likely useless except as a historical curiosity)
0821: The Unknowable Book - The knowledge contained within this book is impossible for a mortal mind to fully comprehend. While it can be read normally with no issue, as soon as the book is closed, the reader will realize that they have no idea what it was they just read, nor any memory of the time spent reading it.
0822: The little ebony black book - Contains the true names of several succubi and incubi. My my my.
0823: The Genealogy of a Bard, Vol. XLII: Descendants by species: Ny - Oo. compiled by M. ffolk.

0838: "The Beginner's Guide to Cryomancy" - The front cover of this book, as well as its contents, are severely burned, and the title is almost illegible
0839: (Dryad's Poetry Book) An untitled book of poetry, that seems to be written on tree bark. Closer examination reveals the book is infused with nature magic, and seems to add new pages over time. The quality of the writing is mediocre.
0840: Everyday Magic by M.M. Selus - A book regarding practical uses for various magical spells in everyday life
0841: Taming the Untamed by R.J. Cezerik - A theoretical essay on combining wild, eldritch, or otherwise non-arcane magic with more "normal" wizardly spellcasting
0842: Amidst the Fae by Ciri Elosin - An account of the writer's travels through fae lands and interactions with the inhabitants thereof. The book is unfinished
0843: The Forbidden Art - ...seems to be a book about machinery. Oddly enough, no magic seems to be involved, although the machines (if functional) could prove potent even without it. (Machinery found within is non-functional; think the diagrams that Leonardo Da Vinci made. Brilliant, but untested and flawed)
0844: Sidereal Travel - A very dull and scholarly text about various methods of non-euclidean travel (such as passing through walls, teleportation, etc). A DC 40 Knowledge: Arcane (DC 30 if playing a wizard with a specialty in Conjuration) check reveals that the information within is horribly out of date
0845: 101 Uses for Sovereign Glue - This book's pages are stuck together
0846: MUSCLEMANCY - This book seems to claim that there exists a form of arcane magic channeled through physical strength. This so-called "Swoleceror" is quite clearly insane.
0847: The Transformative Transhuman- a book detailing on how various methods of transforming yourself using magic into another greater being and possible options, from the benign to the most horrible of lich rituals.
0848: Guide To Acquiring Interplanar Harems- details how you keep the love of both angel and succubus at the same time while making sure that fire genasi doesn't get angry at having to share you, how to summon them all and gain their favor and so on.
0849: Show Me How To Lie- A book detailing how to best use your illusion spells to their fullest potential, when to be subtle with your illusions and when to be spectacular
0850: Screw Wizards! A Sorcerers Guide To Magic- A book explaining magic from a sorcerers point of view, and has proven quite popular with the common folk due to its clear common person reading level way of being written, conversational tone and its snarky asides about how wizards think they know everything. Most people are more likely to refer to this book over any drier text that wizards talk about. Its accurate, but puts every thing simpler and easier to understand terms.
0851: Screw Wizard Academies! A Sorcerers Guide To The Politics of Wizards- one sorcerers account of spending their time at various wizard academies and breaking down how their various methods and social community not only keeps magic out of the hands of the common people where it could benefit more, but also encourages the wizards within to betray each other for knowledge and seek ultimate power without consideration for anyone else, thus keeping knowledge among themselves stagnant and constantly being setback.
0852: Screw Wizard Minds! A Sorcerers Guide to Intelligence- Sets out to debunk the concept that wizards are more intelligent than everyone else by forming the theory of multiple intelligence's and using other forms of magic as proof of them, promoting a message of universal magic acceptance and more free exchange of information between druids, bards, clerics, warlocks, martial artists, sorcerers and so on to learn things that wizards never will being cooped up in their towers.
0853: Screw Sorcerers! A guide for shy young wizards to try to score dates (and other extracurricular activities) with those hot sorcerers and sorceresses.
0854: Bound in His Realm - This fictional book is written from the perspective of a Bound Elemental and details their... unconventional relationship with their summoner. The cover features manacles consisting of fire, lying on a satin sheet
0855: Blindfolded in Her Garden - This book details a man's relationship with a Gorgone. The cover features a statue of a weeping angel.
0856: Shipped and Whipped - A causual skimming of this book suggests it is the story of a slave girl abducted by a ghost ship, falling in love with the captain. The cover features a kneeling girl in half-profile from the back, with her back naked. Above her stands a ghostly handsome man with a whip posed to strike. A more detailed examination reveals that several descrptions of the captain's looks and character have been cross-referenced with The Golem That Wants You!
0857: The Golem That Wants YOU! - A Guide to Creating the Perfect Lover
0858: How to Be the Arcane Man - R, FLAİR
0859: Societal Transmutation: the future impact of magic on our world by Emperor Tippy - This book lays out a vision for the world where magic takes a more substantial role, eliminating food and hunger, providing effortless inter regional trade, creating effective immortality for the masses, and so on. It also provides a guide on how a sufficiently powerful mage could create such a world. It's a wonder it hasn't happened yet...
0860: Our Secret Goblin Overlords by Xela Nienelefin - The author seems to believe that a cabal of goblinoids and hobgoblins secretly suppress the world's technological and magical progression. He claims this cabal knows most goblins have little talent for either magic or tecnology, and the current state benefits them more than the intelligent races, so they try to keep the world at this status quo and make sure no one finds out about them. Unlike other conspiracy thesis', such as a king being replaced by a Rakshasa or illithids taking over a church, this one seems quite insane.
0861: Extinguishing the Day Star by Count Alucard - It appears to be a research paper on a means to destroy the sun. Alucard claims to have talked with all manner of denizens such as illithids and drow in his research, but though he lays out several possibilities from plausible to impossible all are clearly still purely theoretical.
0862: Arcanist Revolution by Kezlar von Yther - A long and rambling script calling for the overthrow of the current world system and the instatement of an "enlightened mageocracy" to guide the masses and lead humanoids to greatness. Quite full of logical fallacies including, but not limited to, begging the question, strawmen, and circular reasoning
0863: Arcanist Devolution by Hexvorazlin, silver great wyrm - This seems to have been written as a direct rebuttal to Arcanist Revolution, as it takes each point in that back and deconstructs the flaws and real world counter-examples to each one. It also bears an incredibly cynical take on humanoids in general, seemingly viewing them as child-like at best.
0864: The Chains of Lust: the Mazzler Edition by Java Tan, Yuroy Mazzler, and Krveero - An infamously poorly written, cliche, groan inducing, and all around bad fiction book about the forbidden love between a half-human half-succubus and a chain devil, featuring a blank-slate female lead that is an obvious audience self-insert and a hunky devil who is not particularly fiendish, aside from the multiple long and drawn out bondage scenes. This edition "improved" with added text compiled by the legendary bard Mazzler, who was able to convince a Gelugon devil named Krveero to offer commentary on the story with him. The book alternates between the horrible original text, Mazzler's snarky comments, and Krveero's seething, unintentionally hilarious rants about how inaccurate and disgraceful everything in the book is about the lower planes. 
0865: From Atop the Dragon's Back: A Series of Faerie Tales and other Stories of Amusement. Collected and edited by the Bard's College.
0866: Weren't There More Of You A Minute Ago? A tome etched in gold plates, which seems initially to be an index of the library, but with books misnumbered and including tomes that aren't there, and mis-titling some that aren't. Burried in it is a plate filled with frustrated scratches and a message that reads, "He's altering them here, too. How can I be sure even this record is beyond his reach?
"0867: Magic Power to the People Manifesto - 
Appears much older than it is due to the inferrio parchment and ink used. Looks to be a screed on giving ""Wizards power"" to Fighters and Rogues. 
The earlier chapters have much underlining and hand written annotations in the margins of such comments as ""That will never work!"", ""The fools"", and ""as if"". Later pages are largely margin comment free, but are even more dog-eared, except for a large ""Uh-Oh"" near the end. "
0868: The Dark Lotus Sutra - A collection of the teachings of Olidammara as they pertain to music, the occult, and armed insurrection (the title is a portmanteau of Dark Lotus (a rap supergroup consistig of ICP and Twiztid) and Lotus Sutra (a holy book of the mahayana denomination of buddhism) )
0869: The Third Degree - a manual of enhanced interrogation techniques used by the Iuzite church of evil elemental fire

0871: Kelt'Hazad's Necromantic Logistics, Delegations and Command Chains(contains the secrets to how, exactly, the BBEGs have proper armies of undead while PCs are stuck with only twice their CL in hit dice, if that)
0872: Gull Dan's Devil Law Guide, a non-Outsider's Guide to Infernal Legal Loopholes (Contains many of the legal loopholes to various common forms of selling one's soul, although the legal jargon involved is written in obscure Infernal terms that even most Devils don't know)
0873: Sticks and bones: Necromancy from scratch, by Dhurnak Angernvil - You found yourself naked and stranded on an island in the middle of nowhere? This is the book you want with you!

0877: 50 shades of iomedae. Book about iomedean priestes and her nights with incubus
0878: The Cuisine of the Blue Tribes. A cooking book. Several of the recipes have been edited with notes, such as "in a pinch, substitute salt with tears" and "delicious with young spider eggs". When cooked according to the edits, the food tastes surprisingly well.
0879: "Kassagar Garsarra" by S. Lukyanenko. This small tome is written in blood and contains various hag rituals pertaining to medicine, such as "Easing pain in the kidneys", "Easing birthing pain without ill to the child", "Killing an unborn without ill to the mother" and "Killing an unborn along with the mother".
0880: Mechaniſms that Technically Count as Warfare – A treatise on gnomish devices that exploded and/or ran amok, particularly those presented as gifts to foreign governments or noble houses. Includes advice to ambassadors and heads of state of non-gnomish nations as to which types of device are most likely to explode and/or run amok (including such advice as "Do notte accept as a gyfte anythinge of gnomiſh manufacture wyth a boiler, or that otherwyſe maketh uſe of combuſtible fuel or high preſsures, for theſe are nigh-certain to detonate, or rupture and ſpew forth fires or ſcalding ſteam" and "Do notte accept a gyfte of any gnomiſh contraption equipped wyth any form of blade, eſpecially if allejed to be for the purpoſe of ſhaving or trymming of beardes or haire, due to the ſtrong probabilitie of a ſlit throate, ſcalping, or decapitation. Conſider the rampage of the Bronze Barber-Surgeon of 581 Pre-Cataclyſm, in whych half the court of Solamnia was ſcalped at the demonſtration before the infernal machine was deſtroyed by the Knyghts of Solamnia").

0882: A Song Of Ice and Fire. A Bard's book to instruct one of how to sing an upbeat happy tale about a wolf who braves through deserts and snow to reunite a loving family of lions.
0883: The Wheel of Time A very dry history book detailing various clocks throughout the ages
0884: The Sword King Phenomenon: one Wizard's investigation into why there are so many farm boys suddenly getting cool swords while being the center of a prophecy that proclaims they are a chosen one to defeat some great evil which somehow ends up making them the king of a kingdom, seeing an alarmingly common pattern in history. The book slowly becomes convinced that this happens because of a world-spanning conspiracy to keep the technology of the world stagnant and unchanging.
0885: ReBalance - Written by an unknown author, the book speaks of several divine decrees referred to as "Errata." Worse yet, this clearly delusional man speaks of huge cataclysmic events in history he calls, "Edition Changes." The Gods, he surmised, have been playing dice with the Mutiverse for ages, treating their lives as one "Terrible game after another."

0927: A journal written in cipher and hidden inks with the Fiendish numeral 3 on the cover, inscribed in the palm of a six-fingered hand. It contains 1/3 of a ritual for an unknown purpose, but after detailing the ritual, the journal ends, leaving half the book blank.
0928: Hollow Victory, by Baron Ignatius Ironhand. The autobiographical, existential lament of a once-zealous conquerer who ultimately found no fulfillment or meaning in his military triumphs or in lordship, and came to regret the senseless bloodshed. The Baron left the original manuscript for this book behind when he suddenly abdicated his throne and vanished from the pages of history, presumably dying in obscurity. The book purportedly holds clues to the location of the enchanted mace the Baron once wielded. Rumors of treasure aside, the book does contain useful firsthand accounts of both employing and countering wizards, clerics, and alchemists in large-unit tactics and logistical capacities.

0951: (unnamed tablet) This is not a book per se, but rather a stone tablet containing the same inscription in three different languages.
