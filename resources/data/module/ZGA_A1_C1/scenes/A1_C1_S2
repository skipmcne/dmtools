"The first of the noble carriages have begun to approach the royal shipyard,
and already the crowd on the bridge is doing its job: cheering, throwing flowers,
and performing folk songs and dances to show their support.
Before things get too busy, your direct superior—Assistant Chief Inspector
Stover Delft—asked you to come to a last-minute meeting to give you your march-
ing orders. You find him chewing a bit of tobacco and eyeing a halfling chef who is
carrying a tray of chocolate confections toward the docked Coaltongue.
His attention turns to you, and he smiles. “Only the finest for our king, right?
“Now then,” he says, “we’re about to earn our pay. Lots of nobles about, so
first, don’t make a scene, and definitely don’t talk to any of the nobility unless
they address you first.
“Second, if something goes wrong, try to handle it yourselves, would you? I’m
going to be busy applying my not-inconsiderable charms to very important people.
The RHC doesn’t get by on just good will and pretty faces, you know.
“And third, you did good work, so I’ve got a surprise for you.”
He grabs his cane and leads you to the gangplank of the Coaltongue. But
he’s not pursuing the halfling chef. Rather, ahead of you waits Principal Minister
Harkover Lee, the king’s chief advisor and personal bodyguard.")
