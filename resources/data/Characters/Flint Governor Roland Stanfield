Flint
Governor
Roland
Stanfield

Stanfield witnessed the fall of the eladrin goddess
Srasama five hundred years ago and died soon
thereafter in the chaos of Elfaivar’s fall. But he
reincarnated, restored to life by a sliver of the divine
power he absorbed when Srasama was slain. His
memories vague and jumbled, he found his way back
to his homeland of Risur and eventually settled in
Flint, then just a modest coastal port.
In the centuries since he has died with irregular
intervals, and with each rebirth he returned to the
city he calls home. For most of that time he has served
as Flint’s governor, having constantly striven to
improve himself with each life, from a simple warrior,
to a humble leader, to an educated renaissance
man nimbly handling the complex challenges of the
fastest-growing city in the world. Stanfield wears a
near-constant expression of contented optimism, but
still occasionally complains of a war wound he took
to his back in his first life.
