Captain
Rutger Smith
The bold and idealistic captain of the R.N.S. Impossible, Captain Smith earned his first command five years ago.
Now 37, he has never led his ship into battle.
That, combined with his fondness for the Malice-era philosophical writings of the monk William Miller, has made him the target of mockery by more established naval officers. 
Smith seems content to just drill his crew twice as hard, encouraging them with philosophical aphorisms between puffs on a cigar.
