A 40-something tiefling with an airy voice and a
fondness for wine that outmatches his ability to
handle his alcohol, Massarde is one of a handful of
Danoran tieflings working for the Risuri military to
help construct warships and other weapons. He has
few kind words for his homeland. He is fascinated
with ice, and carries a wand given him as a gift by a
Drakran train engineer, which can chill small objects
with a touch. Mostly he just uses it as a novelty to cool
beverages.GEOFF
