Principal
Minister
Harkover Lee

Perhaps the most powerful mage
in Risur, Lee acts as King Aodhan’s
bodyguard and chief of staff. Straightbacked
and virile despite being in his
60s, Lee has a slight Ber-tinged accent,
and was said to be quite the ladykiller
in his youth. He always dresses in reds
and golds and carries a solid gold
wizard’s orb tucked into his robes. He
never eats or drinks in public.
