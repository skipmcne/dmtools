Assistant

Inspector
Stover
Delft

A local Flinter in his early 40s, Delft is generally goodnatured
to his subordinates, but has a penchant for
grousing about people behind their backs. He gets
squinty and condescending when his authority is
questioned, but he can recognize talent and good
work. A much better manager than investigator, Delft
has advanced this far in the Constabulary by finding
good agents, supporting them on difficult missions,
and sharing the accolades from their successes.
Delft chews tobacco, and thinks he looks charming
if he grins while sucking on tobacco juices. He walks
with a cane because a mimic tore a chunk out of
his leg fifteen years ago. He has a habit of poking
inanimate objects with the cane before he gets too
close to them, and spitting on them when he wants
to be extra sure
