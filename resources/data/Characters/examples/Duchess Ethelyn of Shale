Duchess
Ethelyn
of Shale

This dark-skinned, distinguished woman in her
60s speaks with a poet’s precision, always pausing
to consider her words before speaking, which
helps those she’s speaking to feel like she’s giving
them her full attention. She dislikes industry and
wears extravagant diamond cluster earrings—
representing the stars of the night sky—to show
her allegiance to the old ways. Accounts tell of her
possessing many different types of magic, though
many of these could be exaggerated.
