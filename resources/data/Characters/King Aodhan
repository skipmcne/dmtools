King
AodhanNow in his 70s, the current king of Risur looks rather
unassuming. He prefers to resolve disputes by being
cool-headed and rationally persuading those who
will listen to his side. For those who won’t, he’s shrewd
enough to give them a sliver of what they want and
then distract them with harmless endeavors while
those worth dealing with get the job done. Despite all
this, though, he trains regularly to keep his stamina
and swordplay robust, and the rites of rulership grant
him daunting magical powers.
