Thames
Grimsley

A grizzled sailor, still with a full head of hair in his early 50s, Grimsley acts as head of a nascent dock workers guild in Flint. 
Though he only worked the docks in his youth, Grimsley spent decades sailing—primarily as captain of a ferry service in Flint’s harbor, but with a stint in the navy during the last Yerasol War.
He took a gash from a policeman’s knife on the side of his face in the last big docker riot, and since then has tried to organize a unified front for the
dockers’ concerns.

 A couple of months working at a theater as a child gave him a very stylized public speaking voice, one full of unnecessary, melodramatic pauses.
