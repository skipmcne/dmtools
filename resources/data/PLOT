Overcoming the Monster Hero learns of a great evil threatening the land, and sets out to destroy it.
Rags to Riches Surrounded by dark forces who suppress and ridicule him, the Hero slowly blossoms into a mature figure who ultimately gets riches, a kingdom, and the perfect mate.
The Quest Hero learns of a great MacGuffin that he desperately wants or needs to find, and sets out to find it, often with companions.
Voyage and Return Hero heads off into a magic land with crazy rules, ultimately triumphs over the madness and returns home far more mature than when he set out.
Comedy Hero and Heroine are destined to get together, but a dark force is preventing them from doing so; the story conspires to make the dark force repent, and suddenly the Hero and Heroine are free to get together. This is part of a cascade of effects that shows everyone for who they really are, and allows two or more other relationships to correctly form.
Tragedy The flip side of the Overcoming the Monster plot. Our protagonist character is the Villain, but we get to watch him slowly spiral down into darkness before he's finally defeated, freeing the land from his evil influence.
Rebirth 
As with the Tragedy plot, but our protagonist manages to realize his error before it's too late, and does a Heelâ€“Face Turn to avoid inevitable defeat.
15 Minutes of Fame  So, it looks like it's just going to be another one of those normal regular old days when, all of a sudden, something exciting happens! One character does something unusual enough that there's a sudden media spotlight on them- there's all this attention headed their way and they can't get enough of it!
