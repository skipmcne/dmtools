Stalag 23

The PCs are imprisoned, and must engineer an escape, overcoming any guards, automatic measures, and geographic isolation their prison imposes on them. 

 Common Twists & Themes: 
Something has happened in the outside world and the prison security has fallen lax because of it. 
The PCs have been hired to "test" the prison - they aren't normal inmates.
Other prisoners decide to blow the whistle for spite or revenge. 
The PCs are undercover to spy on a prisoner, but are then mistaken for real inmates and kept incarcerated.
The PCs must escape on a tight schedule to get to another adventure outside the walls.
